# License-Plate-Recognition-System-using-YOLO-and-EasyOCR

## Introduction

> This project develops a robust License Plate Recognition system built on the Ultralytics YOLO model and EasyOCR for text extraction. It utilizes Google Colab for execution, ensuring access to powerful computing resources and a seamless development environment.

## Features

* Object Detection: Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for fast and accurate object detection, specifically tuned for license plate recognition.
* Text Extraction: Implements EasyOCR to extract alphanumeric characters from the detected license plates.
* Interactive Visualization: Provides real-time image display functionality within Google Colab using cv2_imshow.
* Data Handling: Integrates with Roboflow for efficient data management and version control of datasets.
* Customizable Training: Allows for easy customization of training epochs, image size, and batch sizes.
